## Introduction

Graphene PHP is a PHP-based project developed to facilitate the management and manipulation of data related to graphene, a versatile and remarkable material with applications in various fields, including materials science, electronics, and energy.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, ensure that your environment meets the following prerequisites:

- PHP 7.x or later
- Composer (Dependency Manager for PHP)
- Any web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) with PHP support

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CallmeAbhy/GraphenePHP.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd graphene-php
   ```

3. Install dependencies using Composer:

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

4. Configure your web server to serve the project files.

## Usage

Once the installation is complete, you can start using Graphene PHP in your projects. The project provides a set of PHP classes and functions to handle and process graphene-related data. Refer to the documentation for detailed usage instructions.

```php
// Example usage in a PHP script
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Graphene\GrapheneProcessor;

$grapheneData = ... // Your graphene data
$processor = new GrapheneProcessor($grapheneData);

// Perform operations on the graphene data
$result = $processor->process();

// Output or use the processed result
echo $result;
```
